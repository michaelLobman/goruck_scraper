In honor of Navy Chief Petty Officer Shannon M. Kent, 35, was stationed at the Fort Meade Army installation. She was one of four Americans killed by a suicide bomber in Syria on January 16, 2019. On her fifth combat deployment, she was assigned to a Navy unit that supports the National Security Agency and military Special Operations forces.
Kent’s fellow comrades created and named the workout “Shannon” in her honor. This rigorous 35-minute workout included some of her favorite exercises: burpees, running, and thrusters. Each minute of the Shannon workout celebrates one year of her life. She is survived by her husband and two children.
GORUCK friend and veteran journalist Marty Skovlund Jr. teamed up with Joe Kent to tell the story of this extraordinary human in the new book Send Me: The True Story of a Mother at War.
